Magic Leap,VR Hardware,VR HMD,http://www.magicleap.com/,http://www.vrmeister.com/magic-leap/,"We know what you’re thinking: “Who the heck are we? What is this all about? Why aren’t you saying more?” And you’re right, we need to say a little more about what it is we’re creating.
So what is Magic Leap?
Magic Leap is an idea.
An idea that computing should be shaped and forged to work for us: our life, our physiology, our connected relationships. That exploring human creativity is as great an adventure as exploring space.
It’s an idea based in the belief that people should not have to choose between technology or safety, technology or privacy, the virtual world or the real world.
This belief was born from two simple observations:
That current technologies we use to access the digital world limit, or even take us away, from the real world.
That the future of computing should be derived from respecting human biology, physiology, creativity, and community. Why can’t computing feel completely natural?
With our founding principles our team dug deep into the physics of the visual world, and dug deep into the physics and processes of our visual and sensory perception. We created something new. We call it a Dynamic Digitized Lightfield Signal™ (you can call it a Digital Lightfield™). It is biomimetic, meaning it respects how we function naturally as humans (we are humans after all, not machines).
In time, we began adding a number of other technologies to our Digital Lightfield: hardware, software, sensors, core processors, and a few things that just need to remain a mystery. The result of this combination enabled our technology to deliver experiences that are so unique, so unexpected, so never-been-seen-before, they can only be described as magical.
We are building a world-class team of experience developers, and are reaching out to application wizards, game developers, story-tellers, musicians, and artists who are motivated by just wanting to make cool stuff.
It is all coming together in a pretty awesome way. And we hope to share it with you very soon.
So now what?
We’ll be sharing more information with you in the weeks and months ahead – so stay tuned. In the meantime, thank you for your interest in Magic Leap. We can’t wait to show you what we’ve been up to…",,info@magicleap.com,,United States

gestigon,VR Hardware,VR Haptics & Controllers,http://www.gestigon.com/,http://www.vrmeister.com/gestigon/,"gestigon develops gesture control and body tracking software solutions based on 3D depth data.
Our approach to AR/VR Head Mounted Devices is called Carnival and you can find a short demo video here:
The key concepts of Carnival are:
• True Hand Visualization – no avatar, no guessing of fingers or topologies, that are not visible for the sensor; true dimensions, rings, watches etc are visible and make the hand very “personal”
• Lowest Latency in the Market – the system reacts immediately, the total latency is well below 20 ms (including the data interface to the CPU). This ‘close to zero latency’ enables an incredible user experience (“wow”-effect) and reduces the risk of sea-sickness using the Head Mounted Devices, as the brain of the user recognizes the own hands and thereby has a reference point for the own behavior
• 2D Interaction in a 3D Environment – if you have ever watched people using the existing gesture solutions (from e.g. Leap Motion or MetaView) you will see them tapping in the air with stretched hands and if they are standing up, taking steps into the room. The reason is, that it is fairly easy to target on the x- and y-axis, but – with the lack of reference points – hitting a virtual button or tile on the z-axis is really hard. If you miss, everyone tends to move towards the button/tile. Our interaction concept only uses the x- and y-axis independent of the distance between the sensor and the hands. This makes any interaction much easier and more comfortable as your hand interaction stays within your personal comfort zone in front of you body.
We are continuously developing Carnival: new sensors, new head mounted devices, new gestures and enhanced visualizations.
It will be working for any hardware platform (including google cardboard / Samsung Gear VR approaches that are powered by mobile device CPUs and are not cable connected to a PC), including AR and VR.
Core elements of Carnival are protected by patent applications (pending).",Moritz von Grotthuss,moritz.vongrotthuss@gestigon.com,,"Lübeck, Germany / Sunnyvale USA"

Phasespace,VR Hardware,VR Haptics & Controllers,http://www.phasespace.com/index.html,http://www.vrmeister.com/phasespace/,"PhaseSpace Inc. was founded in 1994 with the mission of developing new technologies and products for emerging motion tracking markets.
Drawing upon the talents of a strong team of scientists and engineers from diverse technical backgrounds, PhaseSpace has developed motion capture solutions for the research, industrial and graphic arts communities.
The PhaseSpace Impulse X2 System was developed as a new generation of 3D optical motion capture systems designed to be affordable to small companies, universities and individuals, lowering the cost of ownership so that it would be a financially feasible tool for a single artist or researcher.
The PhaseSpace system utilizes custom optics and camera technology that leverages Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and synthesized digital signal processor (DSP) technology to deliver real time functionality at a new price threshold.
There are approximately a dozen relatively small companies participating in this market. Current full body optical systems are expensive at an average of $250,000 to $500,000 and do not meet the broad spectrum of customer requirements. Most systems from competitors require a dedicated staff for support and daily use. A complete system including workstation, software and studio modifications can increase the cost per application by several times the hardware costs.
PhaseSpace realized that simply reducing the cost of the hardware was not enough.
Practical cost limitations indicate that systems not only need to be affordable to acquire, but that total cost of ownership must be low. Single-person use, ease of use in non-specialized settings, and removing lighting restrictions common to other motion-capture technologies, are critical to reducing overall cost of use.
Users of the PhaseSpace system won’t need a dedicated room, with black walls and no other light source, and won’t need a team of operators to get the system up and running. Instead, any room in the user’s building will probably work, and can be set up to begin motion capture within an hour or so (often within minutes).
PhaseSpace is the first to introduce a product that breaks the cost barrier with affordable hardware and affordable applications.",Sales,inquiry@phasespace.com,(510) 633-2865,United States

An object (something – Everything, the face of it) is a technical term in philosophy often used in contrast to the term subject.
MAKING IDEAS HAPPEN
The pragmatist Charles S. Peirce defines the broad notion of an object as anything that we can think or talk about.
TESTING IDEAS IN THE REAL WORLD
In a general sense it is any entity: the pyramids, the number seven, a disbelief in predestination or the fear of cats.

Bob Vlemmix, Stephan van den Brink and Tim van Veenendaal started with a simple idea. Our eyes could now experience virtual reality. We noticed that there was no option to bring our hands into this world. Then we thought, why not make it ourselves?
Baby steps.
So Tim started building, and we quickly had our First working prototype. It might not have looked fantastic, but we were proud.
Positive feedback.
We then showed it to many different people. We received a lot of positive reactions. Everybody loved it and started telling their friends.
Start-up time!
It was clear we had something people wanted, so we started to turn the Manus into an actual product. Of course, money was a problem, so like many have done before we did a Kickstarter. And like many start-ups before us, it was not successful. But it did teach us a lot about our product and what it takes to start a company.
StartupBootcamp HighTechXL.
Thanks to the media coverage we ended up at Startupbootcamp HighTechXL in Eindhoven. They invited us to pitch our idea and product. After some selection rounds we were selected to join the accelerator program HighTechXL Eindhoven. Their specialisation? Hardware; just what we needed!
Milestones.
After a few months with the StartupBootcamp program we reached numerous milestones. The team grew from 7 to 15 people! There was no longer a prototype, but an actual Alpha product with it’s own dedicated hardware. We secured several amazing partnerships. The biggest achievement was our funding! Just a week after the program we got to an agreement with two Dutch investors!

Being frustrated with existing navigation and motion solutions we looked for and came up with an idea to make navigation and motion in 3D worlds and environments much easier. Much much easier.
For thirty years we have been asked to move in digital worlds and environments with our hands. The issue is they were not designed for movement: to point yes, to move no. And there is no physiological scheme for movement involving the hands. Our brain is very agile but you cannot change in a few decade what defines a specie.
About 4 million years ago, men stood up for the first time. And since that very first time, man has been on a constant journey in search of new things and ideas. Standing allowed us to become nomads and conquer very large territories. Not only that, our hands became free to develop and use tools that better suited them. Through the efficient use of both our hands and feet, we were able to gain a tremendous amount of power.
In going digital we lost our feet. So, why not put our feet to work in the 3D computer world?",,INFO@3DRUDDER.COM,,"Marseille, France"

This inspired him to search for ways to transport yourself to a different location and actually feeling present. VR was the answer, but all of the content was aimed at gaming. There were no immersive VR videos.
The main problem was the lack of available hardware to shoot such content, so Thierry started researching how to develop his own stereoscopic 360 camera system. This is when he asked his old friend Nick, who has several years of business experience, to join the team and start taking some serious steps towards the first camera prototype. We are now one of the first companies in the world able to produce realistic cinematic VR experiences and are continuously pushing this new medium to its absolute limits.

These games ended up taking off outside DigiPen and they were honored with the opportunity to present them around the world at award events like IGF, Indie Game Challenge, IndieCade, IndiePub, PAX10, Sense of Wonder Night, and others. Nitronic Rush in particular was well received by consumers, and since its release in 2011 the game has been downloaded well over a million times.
After graduating
After graduating from DigiPen, several of the other developers on their student projects like Nitronic Rush took jobs in the AAA game industry or went to work on other projects. When looking at what the Refract team wanted to do next, they realized that they’re too passionate about making smaller independent games to stop now. With the encouragement of other indie devs they had met over the years, they started their own studio and continued to focus on experiences that they’re incredibly passionate about.
Distance
Distance is Refract’s debut title and a spiritual successor to Nitronic Rush. It’s a survival racing game that combines the intense action of arcade racing with the exploration of an atmospheric world. You control a unique car that allows you to boost, jump, rotate, and even fly through a chaotic and mysterious city.",,ellie@refract.com,,United States

Audio Arena
Audio Arena is a single player arena game in which the gameplay is generated by music. The arena stretches 360 degrees around you and the enemies get spawned on the beat of the music. Dodge your enemies using head-tilt controls. Powerups are placed in the arena to kill your foes. Picking them up on the beat of the music increases your sync bonus for higher scores. At the end of the song your score will be recorded, if you can make it that far.
History
This game started as my entry into the Oculus Mobile VR Jam 2015 where it was a bronze price winner. Now that prototype has been developed into a full game for Gear VR.
Features
Gameplay is generated by music.
Super smooth head-tilt controls.
20 awesome songs, 25 unique quests.
Plays great sitting and standing, plays amazingly in a swivel chair.
Developed for VR from the ground up.

Would you like to see what your home will look like before it’s built? Did you know that a virtual reality walkthrough is the most accurate way of presenting your dream home?
We offer a virtual reality architectual design visualization experience. We use Oculus Rift technology to show your home design from both interior and exterior perspectives. You can virtually ‘walk’ through your design and get a true impression of how your ideas come together. Due to an immersion feeling, the best quality and surround music, you can assess how closely your ideas meet your expectations.
Would you like to apply changes to your project  during a walkthrough in ‘real time’?
You can! It`s amazing how technology can help us with difficult choices. Due to the Unreal 4 engine that we use, you are able to change the color or material of any surface contained in your design. Also switching between multiple furniture models is simple. Best of all is that these tasks can be done individually and in ‘real time’!  Any interior looks different at a daytime and night, so there is an option of turning on/off the sunlight.  We give you a possibility of creating the home of your dreams with no dissapointment after it`s been built.
What kind of technology do we run?
State of the art technology of course! We do all that we can to create interiors as close to reality as possible. We work on Oculus Rift DK2 and in the near future we will present interiors on HTC Vive, Oculus Rift CV1 and other hi-tech products.
Would you like to look at your virtual interior at your convenience or show it to your friends? No problem! Not only will you be able to ‘walk’ through the interiors on your own with a VR headset, but on PC screen as well. We also format interiors for use on smartphones with  Google Cardboard or Samsung Gear VR.

Matterport,Virtual Tours,Real Estate,http://matterport.com/,http://www.vrmeister.com/matterport/,"About
Matterport is a silicon valley technology company that makes it easy for anyone to create immersive cloud-based 3D models of real-world spaces that can be experienced, changed, and shared online.
Technology
The Matterport 3D System uses a patented camera, controlled through the user’s Apple iPad, to capture 3D and 2D images of an interior space. The camera rotates on a tripod that the user places around a room to capture every aspect of the space. Matterport’s proprietary technology then stitches together the data to create one complete 3D mesh with images overlaid onto all surfaces.  These models are then ready for users to walk through the interior, view as a doll-house, or see a floorplan through Matterport’s immersive online interface. The models also include complete linear and area measurement data. The resulting model can be viewed, modified, annotated, and shared using any computer or the Apple iPad.
Industries Served
Real Estate, Home improvement, Furnishings & Decor, Property Insurance, Real Estate Management, Construction Management, Hotels & Vacation Rentals, Retail Space Planning, Forensics, Animation, Public & Private Security and many others.
Matterport’s Purpose
Matterport enables anyone to digitally reconstruct real-world spaces for use in VR, AR, web, and mobile applications, offering an unprecedented level of immersion and the most realistic sense of actually being there. Our Matterport Spaces can be explored through our browser-based app, called 3D Showcase, as well as on highly immersive VR platforms, like Samsung Gear VR.
Matterport’s unique ecosystem gives people the freedom to experience any place, at any time. Our end-to-end immersive media platform is a quick, easy and affordable way to capture and explore real world spaces in immersive and photo-realistic 3D and VR. Matterport Spaces have tremendous applications in many industries, including real estate, hospitality, travel, event planning, media and entertainment, architecture, construction, retail and many more.",NA,NA,(650) 641-2241,United States

Boom Headshot Studios,VR Development,VR Studios,http://www.twitter.com/Diluted_NZ,http://www.vrmeister.com/boom-headshot-studios/,"Born in 1978; I have been a gamer for as long as I can remember.
I feel the time has come to give back something of the enjoyment I have received from the gaming industry to a new generation – namely those who will be growing up with Virtual Reality.
“Modern” or “Statistic based” forms of character damage will no longer suffice in the brave new world of VR, I fear.  I believe it is time to come up with a new system; do so quickly; and choose one which mimics “Physical Reality” as closely as possible.
At this point in time, I’d like to call your attention to this video, which demonstrates how modern firearms are tested for effectiveness against human tissue and other materials.  This is a scientific process, known as Ballistics Testing; is admissible as evidence in court; and would also be the basis for any work myself or my studio would do.
I use these words interchangeably, because as it stands there is no studio.  Just me – a man whose imagination outdoes his abilities in this field.
DMM
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Molecular_Matter
How would this task be approached?  By using a programming technology known as Digital Molecular Matter, or DMM.  To quote from the above link from Wikipedia…
Function
DMM is a physical simulation system which models the material properties of objects allowing them to break and bend in accordance to the stress placed on them. Structures modeled with DMM can break and bend if they are not physically viable. Objects made of glass, steel, stone and jelly are all possible to create and simulate in real-time with DMM. The system accomplishes this by running a finite element simulation that computes how the materials would actually behave.”
By this logic, it should be able to create “Virtual Ballistics Gel” and therefore by extension “Virtual Human Flesh” in a software environment; for any number of scientific, medical, military or civilian simulation.  Oh, and at this stage I would like to interject that “human flesh” would just be the start.  Full musculature and skeletal constructs should also be possible to model in Virtual Reality.  This will allow players to kill and be killed with an amount of creativity that has never been seen before in conventional gaming…
Perhaps at this point you are excited, or would like to know more about my ideas?  Feel free to get in touch with me, and we will explore the VR inevitability in greater depth…",Tony Spencer,Diluted_NZ@hotmail.com,,New Zealand

Our goal is to make learning something new a lot easier for students of all ages. We believe that Virtual Reality can strongly improve the capacity of the human mind to remember the things it learned for a long time. According the Cone of Learning created by Edgard Dale, the american educatonist, after two weeks, the human brain tends to remember 10% of what it reads, 20% of what it hear but 90% of what it does or simulate. Learning through Virtual Reality is situated in those impressive 90%. Imagine a world where students remember almost everything of what they learn… That’s what we are aiming at.
Who can use Unimersiv?
Everyone with Virtual Reality headset such as the Oculus Rift, the Samsung Gear VR or the Google Cardboard. We are working hard to make the experiences we create available for all of those headset. If the course you want to follow is not available yet for your headset, don’t worry, it will be in the coming weeks.
Who is creating those Virtual Reality experiences?
Our team of 3D experts is constantly working on new VR educational experiences but we also encourage VR developers to add their educational content on Unimersiv! If you are working on an educational VR experience, send us an email and we will be happy to feature it on Unimersiv if it follows our guidelines.
Our mission statement
Unimersiv’s mission is to help students of all ages learn anything faster through virtual reality.
The first VR learning platform
We believe that virtual reality should not only be use for gaming but also for education. As research has shown, students remember 20% of what they hear, 30% of what they see and up to 90% of what they do or simulate. Virtual reality yields the latter scenario impeccably; students can interact with the virtual environment in person and manipulate the various objects within it. This supports “learning by doing” and also results in creativity by constructionism.
We see Unimersiv as the first VR learning platform. A place on which people can come every weeks to learn something new in virtual reality. Virtual reality can give you experiences no educational book or video could and we want to embrace that.",,contact@unimersiv.com,,France

Matterport is a silicon valley technology company that makes it easy for anyone to create immersive cloud-based 3D models of real-world spaces that can be experienced, changed, and shared online.
Technology
The Matterport 3D System uses a patented camera, controlled through the user’s Apple iPad, to capture 3D and 2D images of an interior space. The camera rotates on a tripod that the user places around a room to capture every aspect of the space. Matterport’s proprietary technology then stitches together the data to create one complete 3D mesh with images overlaid onto all surfaces.  These models are then ready for users to walk through the interior, view as a doll-house, or see a floorplan through Matterport’s immersive online interface. The models also include complete linear and area measurement data. The resulting model can be viewed, modified, annotated, and shared using any computer or the Apple iPad.
Industries Served
Real Estate, Home improvement, Furnishings & Decor, Property Insurance, Real Estate Management, Construction Management, Hotels & Vacation Rentals, Retail Space Planning, Forensics, Animation, Public & Private Security and many others.

Matterport enables anyone to digitally reconstruct real-world spaces for use in VR, AR, web, and mobile applications, offering an unprecedented level of immersion and the most realistic sense of actually being there.

With Holo, it will enable applications in which live presentation of physical real world elements is incorporated with the virtual elements, which is referred to as “holograms”.
And AR a live direct or indirect view of a physical, real world environments whose elements are augmented by computer generated sensory input like graphics, sound, video or GPS data.
